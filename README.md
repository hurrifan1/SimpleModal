# SimpleModal | Qlik Sense Extension

SimpleModal is a very basic Qlik Sense extension with one purpose: To provide you with a button that displays a customizable modal.

## Why?

I had a use case for one and I didn't like the options that were otherwise available to me. It was also a chance to learn how to create an extension. I had been wanting to dive into building one with Nebula so this was my opportunity.

  - Button label
  - Button font size
- Modal settings

  - Option to close the modal by clicking outside of it
- Button background

- Button border

  - Border width
  - Border color (color picker or by expression)
